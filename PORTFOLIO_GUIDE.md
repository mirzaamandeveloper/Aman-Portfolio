# Mohammed Aman Baig - Production Portfolio

## Overview
A professional, engineer-focused portfolio built with modern web standards. This is NOT a student portfolio—it communicates systems thinking, problem-solving ability, and production readiness.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (subtle, purposeful)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Deployment Ready**: Optimized builds, clean architecture

## Page Structure

### 1. **Hero Section** (`NewHero.jsx`)
- **Headline**: "I turn unclear problems into working systems."
- **Subheading**: Full-Stack + AI Engineer | Java • Python • React • Node • Machine Learning
- **CTAs**: "View My Thinking" & "See Systems I Built"
- Clean, minimal design focusing on clarity

### 2. **How I Approach Problems** (`ThinkingSection.jsx`)
Three core cards explaining engineering philosophy:
- **Problem First**: Understanding constraints before coding
- **Build → Break → Improve**: Testing limits and iterating for scalability
- **Engineer Mindset**: Clean architecture, performance, and maintainability

### 3. **Systems I Built** (`SystemsSection.jsx`)
Production-ready projects with detailed explanations:

**AI Plant Disease Detection System**
- Problem: Farmers lose crops to preventable diseases
- Solution: Computer vision system for real-time detection
- Key Decisions: TensorFlow + MobileNet, data augmentation, edge optimization
- Outcome: 92% accuracy across 5 crop diseases
- Stack: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, FastAPI, React Native

**E-Commerce Backend System**
- Problem: Need to handle 50,000+ daily concurrent users
- Solution: Scalable REST APIs with proper auth and payment integration
- Key Decisions: MongoDB for flexibility, JWT for stateless auth, Redis caching
- Outcome: Sub-200ms API response times
- Stack: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Redis

**Personal Portfolio Website**
- Problem: Portfolio must communicate engineer mindset with exceptional performance
- Solution: React + Vite for instant loading, responsive design
- Key Decisions: Mobile-first, Framer Motion for purposeful animations
- Outcome: Perfect Lighthouse scores, <1s first contentful paint
- Stack: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion

Each system includes:
- Problem it solves
- System design overview
- Key technical decisions
- Metrics/outcomes
- Trade-offs made

### 4. **What I Build With** (`SkillsSection.jsx`)
Skills organized as systems, not buzzwords:

**Frontend Engineering**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, TypeScript
**Backend Engineering**: Node.js, Express, Java, MongoDB, REST APIs, Auth, Redis
**AI & Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, FastAPI, Model Optimization
**Developer Tools & Cloud**: Git, Docker, Linux, CI/CD, Deployment

### 5. **What Makes Me Different** (`DifferenceSection.jsx`)
Five differentiators:
- AI + Full Stack combined
- Product thinking over assignments
- Focus on impact, not just code
- Preparing for industry before graduation
- Systems thinking, not just features

### 6. **Proof, Not Claims** (`ProofSection.jsx`)
Direct links to:
- **GitHub**: Open source contributions and code
- **LinkedIn**: Professional background
- **Email**: Direct contact for opportunities

### 7. **Final CTA** (`CTASection.jsx`)
**Message**: "If you're building something meaningful and need someone who learns fast and thinks deep — let's talk."

**Buttons**:
- Email: mdamaanbaig2484@gmail.com
- LinkedIn: Connect
- GitHub: View code

### 8. **Hidden Route: `/thinking`** (`ThinkingPage.jsx`)
**URL**: `http://localhost:5174/thinking`

A transparent section on engineering mistakes and continuous improvement:

**Mistakes Made**:
- Overengineering Early
- Ignoring Performance Until Production
- No Tests Until Crisis
- Underestimating Deployment Complexity
- Not Asking for Help Early
- Perfectionism Over Progress

**What Comes Next**:
- Building distributed tracing systems
- Implementing chaos engineering
- Production code experience
- Open source contributions
- Studying distributed systems deeply

## Design Philosophy

✅ **Minimal, Dark Theme**: Gray-950 background with subtle borders
✅ **Apple/Vercel Aesthetic**: Clean typography, ample whitespace
✅ **Subtle Animations**: Scroll-triggered transitions, hover effects
✅ **Mobile-First**: Fully responsive (mobile → tablet → desktop)
✅ **Readable Typography**: Clear hierarchy and contrast
✅ **Engineer-Focused**: Systems thinking > flashy design
